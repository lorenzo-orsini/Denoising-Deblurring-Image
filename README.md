# Denoising-Deblurring-Image
The task consists in creating a denoising - deblurring deep learning model, aimed to remove gaussian blur and gaussian noise from images taken from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  In particular, the dataset was built starting from CIFAR-10 images collection, which are modified with gaussian noise and blur. The deep learning model that I have developed for this task is a Convolutional Neural Network followed by an Autoencoder.
